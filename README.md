# MSCS532_Assignment4

This repository contains a report and Python code files focused on sorting algorithms and priority queues, specifically using heaps.

## Repository Contents

- **Report**: Detailed analysis of heap data structure and sorting techniques.
- **Python Code Files**:
  - `heapSort.py`: Implements heap sort using a max-heap for efficient sorting.
  - `priorityQueue.py`: Implements a priority queue using a binary heap, with core operations like insert, extract, and modify priority.
  - `heapComparison.py`: Compares the performance of heap sort with other popular sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) for different dataset sizes.

This project is ideal for understanding heap-based sorting and priority queues, along with performance benchmarking.
python3 heapSort.py/heapComparison.py/priorityQueue.py for checking the sorting and comparison of different sorting algorithms compared to heap sort
